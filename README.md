# CarRental
Car Rental Management System (Using JavaX and JavaAWT)
- Using java and Netbeans Ide the project has been created.
- We can just drag and drop the elements using Netbeans to make it powerful and then provide the functionality to the created elements.
- src/car has the .java files through which we get access to the files that have been developed.
- After the UI is created the database is connected to the project using my-sql-connector that will take up the data from the SQL that should be created prior to the project creation.
- The UI developed is also based on the Schema that has been validated.
- Detailed info on Schema and different Tables in the project is available in (Tables and Scehmas.png)
(Netbeans will ask for resolving problems when the project is imported into the Netbeans IDE, they can be resolved using the .jar files that exist in the project itself)
